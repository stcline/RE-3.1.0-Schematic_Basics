# :robot: Schematic Design

## ü§ì Overview and learning outcomes 

The goal of this lab assignment is to teach some of the basics of electronics schematics.  We will use them extensively this year.  You will both read and write schematics on your own. üöÄ

## What is a Schematic?

A circuit schematic shows a component-level view of your electronic system. Components can appear as individual blocks in a circuit with inputs and outputs, or as the typical component symbols you would see in a circuit diagram. Complex devices like logic gates are shown as blocks to eliminate the need to show every single transistor and the passives in the component. This makes your circuit schematic a very convenient way to show connections between passive components, ICs, and other components like connectors.

If you have not alreay done so read the section from All About Circuits which describes [Electronics Schematics](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/understanding-schematics/) and watch the video here to help you visualize what these are:

## The Circuit Simulator App

In order to draw your own schematics online, we will employ the [Circuit Simulator App](https://thumbsdb.herokuapp.com/circuit/).  This app runs on any browser and eaily allows us to save and share our circuit designs.  Plactice using the app for a while.  Notice it also has a feature that simulates current flows which is useful in visualizing the electrons moving (or not moving) through the circuit.

## üíª Terms to know

## üìù Next steps
In the lab are three circuits that have been built on three demo breadboards.  Photos are found below.


Build each circuit in the Circuit Simulator App and test them to see if they work.  One of them does not.  Figure out which one using the app to prove it.  Save your three circuits as text files named in the following manner:

- circuit_1[last_name].txt
- circuit_2[last_name].txt
- circuit_3[last name].txt

Print each of the three circuits to pdf and name them in the same fashion as above but make sure the file extension is pdf, not txt.

Create a new directory in this repository called "circuit_files" and upload those six files to it.
